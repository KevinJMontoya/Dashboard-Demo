Union Dashboard — Demo Project
Overview
The Union Dashboard is a conceptual demo project created to showcase UI/UX design, front-end development, and data visualization skills in a labor-focused context.
This project is not a production application. It was built strictly for demonstration and portfolio purposes to illustrate how a modern union or worker-focused organization might present membership data, announcements, and engagement metrics in a clean, accessible dashboard.
Purpose

Demonstrate dashboard layout and information hierarchy
Showcase UI/UX decisions for clarity, accessibility, and usability

Simulate a real-world internal tool a union or organization could use
All data shown in this project is placeholder / mock data.
